            Yes you can, we encourage it. Use the form to the right (or below if you're on a cell phone) to send us your idea. We will not respond to you though. We will keep track of your email address with your submission, if your card gets a place in a deck you will be rewarded with something special as a thanks. No monetary compensations though, a warm thank you and something cool from our inventory.

            God maybe, we don't care. This game is protected under the First Amendment. It was made to be offensive, that was our goal. If you still wish to bitch use the form to the right (or below if you're on a cell phone) to send us your two cents. We will post it on the site if we chose. It's part of the terms of use for this site, go away if you don't like it.
